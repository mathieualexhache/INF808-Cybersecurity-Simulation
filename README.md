# INF808-Cybersecurity-Simulation

## Description

This project aims to simulate Web/OS credential dumping and process injection attacks using **MITRE Caldera** in a controlled Azure Cloud environment. It consists of three virtual machines (VMs) designed to replicate realistic attack scenarios on Windows endpoints. To collect and aggregate logs, we use **Splunk**, with the **STIX-Shifter** connector formatting cyber-observable objects in STIX 2.1. The **Kestrel** runtime engine in Jupyter Notebook is employed to create an interactive threat-hunting notebook.

Additionally, we leverage open-source tools like the **Arango TAXII server** to share Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) generated during the simulation. The **cti-taxii-client** by OASIS is used to consume and post intelligence to the TAXII server. We also utilize **stix2arango**, a CLI tool for inserting STIX 2.1 bundles and objects into **ArangoDB**. Kestrel Jupyter Notebook kernel is integrated for log correlation, investigation, and visualizations. This exploratory project is solely for academic purposes, aimed at enhancing learning and providing valuable resources for students in cybersecurity.
