# INF808-Cybersecurity-Simulation

## Description

This project aims to simulate OS credential dumping and process DLL injection attacks using Caldera in a controlled Azure Cloud environment. It consists of three virtual machines (VMs) designed to replicate realistic attack scenarios on Windows endpoints. Utilizing Splunk for log collection and aggregation, we incorporate the STIX-Shifter connector to format cyber-observable objects in STIX 2.1. The Kestrel runtime engine in Jupyter Notebook is employed to create a threat-hunting notebook.

Additionally, we leverage open-source tools like the Arango TAXII server to share Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) generated during simulation. The cti-taxii-client by OASIS will be used to consume and post intelligence to the TAXII server. We also utilize the stix2arango, a CLI tool that takes STIX 2.1 bundles and objects and inserts them into ArangoDB. Kestrel Jupyter Notebook kernel is integrated for logs correlation, investigation and visualizations. This exploratory project is solely for academic purposes. Logs, code, and results will be shared to enhance learning and provide valuable resources for students in cybersecurity.
